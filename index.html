        <h2>Project Aetherium, a placeholder name</h2>
        <p>
            A bundle of hopes, dreams and good intentions to make a 2D roguelite RPG with an evolving open world and a natural ecosystem with a main focus on emergent gameplay.

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <p>
            Inspirations are taken from a vast amount of games out there. There are however a couple of games where a circle can be drawn around a certain feature or idea that closely resembles what is envisioned for project Aetherium.
